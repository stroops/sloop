# Sloop — Hands-on Usage (dogfooding guide)

A practical, example-driven walkthrough. For the "what & why", see `README.md`.

> **Requirements:** Go 1.26 to build. A **tmux-compatible multiplexer** for the orchestration
> features (`run --split`, `ps`, `send`, `attach`): **tmux** on macOS/Linux, or **[psmux]**
> (native, tmux-CLI-compatible) on Windows — no WSL needed. sloop auto-detects `tmux` then `psmux`;
> override with `SLOOP_MUX=<binary>`. Plain `sloop run` works without any multiplexer (single tool).
> The AI tool binaries you target (`claude`, `cursor`/`agent`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `agy`)
> must be installed for sloop to launch them.

## 0. Build

```sh
go build -o ~/bin/sloop ./cmd/sloop   # or: go install ./cmd/sloop
sloop doctor                          # check tools + tmux are detected
```

`sloop doctor` example:
```
Tools:
  ✓ claude 1.x
  ✗ codex
  ...
tmux: ✓ tmux 3.4
mode: ask
```

---

## 1. Set up a project (once per repo)

From inside an existing codebase:

```sh
cd ~/code/my-service
sloop init
```

This creates:
```
AGENTS.md            # canonical context — YOU write this (the source of truth)
.sloop/
  config.yaml        # version, enabled tools + default tool (auto-detected)
  skills/            # reusable *.md skills
  vault/             # personal notes (not delivered to tools)
  .gitignore
```

On a real terminal `sloop init` is **interactive** — it shows the tools it detected and asks whether to
pre-fill `AGENTS.md` from your codebase, create the standard provider folders, and install status
hooks, so a newcomer is set up in a few keystrokes. Piped/CI or `--auto`/`-y`/`--no-input` skip the
prompts and keep the scriptable behavior (flags only).

`init` also **delivers context for every detected tool** right away — it writes the pointer files
(`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, …) and links `.sloop/skills`, so the workspace is usable immediately
(no separate `sloop sync` needed first). It prints a per-tool summary of what it created. The personal
`vault/` is gitignored; `config.yaml` and `skills/` are committed (shared with your team).

Add `--scaffold` (`-S`) to also create each enabled tool's **standard folders** (e.g. `.claude/skills`,
`.claude/agents`, `.cursor/rules`, `.codex/skills`) — driven by the adapter manifests, so you start
from the provider's expected layout:

```sh
sloop init --scaffold
```

Or let sloop pre-fill `AGENTS.md` from the existing codebase (language, build/test/lint commands —
a `Makefile` target wins — project layout, and a README seed) instead of an empty starter:

```sh
sloop init --scan
```

Either way, then edit `AGENTS.md` with the rest of your guidance (overview, conventions). Commit
`AGENTS.md` and `.sloop/` to git — they're shared with your team. `--scan` is heuristic and offline
(no LLM, no API key); it never overwrites an existing `AGENTS.md`.

---

## 2. Launch a tool

```sh
sloop run                 # launch the default tool, context synced first
sloop run claude          # launch a specific tool
sloop run agent           # binary alias works too (agent → cursor)
sloop run -m sonnet       # a model: -m forwards it to the tool (default tool)
sloop run opus            # a bare model → its vendor's home CLI (opus → claude --model opus)
sloop run claude -m sonnet -e high   # tool + model + reasoning effort (low|medium|high)
sloop run -p cursor -m opus          # name the CLI explicitly with --provider/-p
sloop run claude -- --resume         # everything after -- is passed straight to the tool
sloop run -w my-service claude       # target a registered workspace from anywhere (no cd)
```

**Picking a tool / model / effort.** `run <token>` accepts a tool (`claude`), its binary
(`agent`→cursor), or a model alias (`opus`→its home CLI). Flags are explicit: `-p/--provider` the CLI,
`-m/--model` the model, `-e/--effort` (`low|medium|high`). sloop **forwards the model string as-is and
never validates it** — the CLI accepts or rejects it; selection is the CLI's own step, sloop just makes
it a one-liner. If a CLI has no model/effort knob, `-m`/`-e` errors clearly (run it and pick inside, or
pass flags after `--`). `-m <Tab>` completes the known aliases. Which knobs each CLI exposes lives in
its adapter manifest — see [run.md](../design/run.md) and [ADAPTERS.md](../reference/ADAPTERS.md).

What `run` does: ensures `AGENTS.md`, writes pointer files (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`),
symlinks `.sloop/skills` into the tool's skills dir, records the session, then launches —
inside a tmux session named `<workspace>__<tool>` when tmux is present.

**Status bar:** each sloop session shows its own live status in the tmux bar, e.g.
`⚓ myrepo claude ◆ waiting` (the status word is colored: yellow waiting · cyan working · green idle),
refreshed every 2s. It's set **per session** so it never touches your global tmux config. Adopted
sessions get it too; add it to any session with `sloop statusline setup`.

### Side-by-side panes (the orchestration win)

```sh
sloop run --split claude cursor      # one tmux window, two panes, same repo, side by side
sloop run --split                    # just the default tool (one pane)
```

Great for running two agents on the same code and comparing, or a coder + a reviewer.

---

## 3. Manage the fleet (`sloop ps`)

The answer to "too many AI windows". From anywhere:

```sh
sloop ps
```

```
⚓ AI fleet — 2 running, 1 waiting on you

  1   webapp           claude    ◆ waiting on you · active 3m ago
      └ │ Waiting for your approval to edit main.go
  2   my-service       cursor    ▸ working · active just now
      └ Running tests... 12 passed

jump: sloop ps <#>   ·   send: sloop send <#> "msg"
```

- Each session is classified from **its own terminal** (non-invasive — sloop never
  reads the provider): `◆ waiting on you` (blocked on an approval/question), `▸ working`,
  `○ idle`, or `● attached`. **Sessions waiting on you float to the top** so you see who
  needs you first. Install the Claude hooks (below) to make this status **authoritative**
  instead of a heuristic.
- The `└` line is the session's last terminal output (the glance).
- sloop **reads what each waiting agent is asking** (from its own pane — no LLM, no API) and shows the
  question + answer keys, e.g. `Apply changes? · answer: [y]es [n]o` or `[1]Yes [2]No`.
- On a real terminal, `sloop ps` is a **control center** — `↑/↓` (or `j/k`) to move, then act on the
  highlighted session in place: press its **answer key** (`y`/`n` or `1`/`2`…) to reply, `Enter` jumps,
  `s` sends a free-text reply, `x` kills (with a confirm), `q`/`Esc` quits. Piped/CI prints the plain
  listing. Colors honor `NO_COLOR`/`--no-color`.
- Jump straight to one:

```sh
sloop ps 2          # attach (or switch-client if you're already inside tmux)
sloop attach webapp__claude   # attach by full session name
```

### Live monitor (`--watch`) and filtering (`--waiting`)

```sh
sloop ps --waiting             # show only agents waiting on you
sloop ps -f                    # follow live (alias of --watch): refresh every 2s, ring the bell
sloop ps -f -n 5s              # custom interval
sloop ps -f --notify           # also fire a desktop notification on new waiting agents
sloop ps -f --waiting          # monitor, but only list those that need you
```

> `-f` (follow) is the short for `--watch`. `-w` is reserved for `--workspace` everywhere
> (`run`/`sync`), so it is intentionally not a `ps` shorthand.

### Precise status via Claude's own hooks

The pane heuristic is a good guess; Claude's hooks make it exact. Install once per repo:

```sh
sloop hooks install     # merges into .claude/settings.local.json (idempotent, never clobbers)
sloop hooks print       # or print the JSON snippet to add by hand
```

This registers three of Claude's documented hooks — `UserPromptSubmit` → working,
`Notification` → waiting on you, `Stop` → idle — each calling `sloop hook <state>`, which
records the session's status under `~/.sloop/state`. `sloop ps` then **prefers that marker**
over the heuristic (falling back to the heuristic if no fresh marker exists). This stays
within the provider's rules: Claude calls sloop through its **own** hook mechanism; sloop
never intercepts or injects. Markers older than 15 min are ignored so a crashed session
can't get stuck "waiting".

**Multi-provider:** every major CLI now has a hook/notify system. `sloop hooks list` shows the
matrix, and `sloop hooks print <tool>` prints the exact event → `sloop hook <state>` wiring for
each (Claude and Gemini auto-install; Cursor/Copilot/Codex are print-and-paste for now):

```
sloop hooks list
TOOL      AUTO-INSTALL  CONFIG
claude    yes           .claude/settings.local.json
gemini    yes           .gemini/settings.json
cursor    print+paste   .cursor/hooks.json
copilot   print+paste   ~/.copilot/hooks/notification-hooks.json
codex     print+paste   ~/.codex/config.toml  (notify = [...])
```

Hook knowledge lives in each tool's adapter manifest (see `docs/reference/ADAPTERS.md`), so adding a provider
is "drop one yaml". `sloop tools` shows the full capability matrix (context / skills / hooks).

### Whole cross-repo board (`ps --all`)

`sloop ps` lists what's live; `sloop ps --all` also lists registered workspaces that **aren't**
running, with their repo path — the full picture of every project, not just the running ones:

```sh
sloop ps --all
```
```
⚓ AI fleet — 1 running
  1   api          claude    ◆ waiting on you · active 2m ago

Known workspaces (not running):
  ○ web              ~/code/web
  ○ infra            ~/code/infra

start one: sloop run -w <name>
```

`--watch` turns `ps` from a snapshot into a live board: it re-renders on the interval and,
whenever a session **newly** starts waiting on you, rings the terminal bell (and, with
`--notify`, shows an OS notification via `osascript`/`notify-send`). Captures run concurrently,
so even a large fleet refreshes quickly. Ctrl-C to stop.

### Answer an agent without attaching (`sloop send`)

When `ps` shows an agent `◆ waiting on you`, reply without switching to it:

```sh
sloop send 1 "yes, go ahead"                    # by fleet number (from ps)
sloop send webapp__claude "use the opus model"  # by full session name
sloop send webapp "run the tests"               # by workspace (if it has one session)
```

`send` types the message into that session's pane and presses Enter — exactly as if you
typed it yourself (via `tmux send-keys`; the provider is never intercepted). Great for
unblocking an agent across repos without losing your place.

Broadcast to many at once, or end sessions:

```sh
sloop ps --all                         # also lists tmux sessions you started yourself (unmanaged)
sloop adopt agy -w myrepo --as agy     # bring an external session into the fleet (rename to myrepo__agy)
sloop approve --waiting                # send each waiting agent its Yes/Approve answer (one command)
sloop approve 1                        # approve just session #1
sloop send --waiting "yes, go ahead"   # custom reply to every agent waiting on you
sloop send --all "stash and pause"     # every running session (asks to confirm)
sloop kill 2                           # end one session (asks to confirm; -y to skip)
sloop kill --waiting                   # end all that are waiting
sloop kill --all -y                    # clean up everything (global -y = assume yes)
```

### Fleet HUD popup (tmux ≥ 3.2)

Pop the whole cross-repo fleet over whatever you're doing — glance, answer, jump, and it closes back
to your work without losing your place:

```sh
sloop popup                  # open the fleet popup now (must be inside tmux)
sloop popup setup            # bind <prefix> g to it (and print the line for ~/.tmux.conf)
sloop popup setup --key f    # use a different key
```

After `setup`, press your tmux **prefix then `g`** from inside any agent to summon the HUD: the `ps`
control center appears floating, you answer/jump with one key, and the popup vanishes. (Native Windows
psmux may not support popups; everything else still works.)

---

## 4. Context delivery without launching

```sh
sloop sync               # (re)deliver for the default tool
sloop sync claude        # a specific tool
sloop sync --all         # every enabled tool
sloop sync --repair      # if a file/dir you didn't create occupies a target,
                         # move it aside (*.sloopbak-<ts>) and write sloop's — never deletes
sloop status             # one-line delivery state
```

`sloop status` example:
```
⚓ my-service  ~/code/my-service
  tools:    claude*, codex, cursor, gemini  (* default)
  context:  AGENTS.md ok · CLAUDE.md ok
  skills:   3 in .sloop/skills · linked: claude
  hooks:    auto: claude, gemini  (sloop hooks list)
  running:  2 sessions  (sloop ps)
```

Delivery is **create-if-missing**: sloop never overwrites a file you hand-authored (it warns).
`AGENTS.md` is always yours — sync/repair never touch it.

---

## 5. Skills (shared across every tool)

```sh
sloop skills new code-review                                  # scaffold + link into your tools
sloop skills add https://example.com/review.md               # import from a URL
sloop skills add https://github.com/o/r/blob/main/review.md  # GitHub blob URL (auto-raw)
sloop skills add <url> --name custom-name                    # override the derived name
sloop skills update                                          # re-fetch every imported skill
sloop skills update code-review                              # re-fetch just one
```

Skills live in `.sloop/skills/*.md` and are **symlinked** into each tool's skills dir — write or
import once, every tool sees the same set. `skills new`/`add` link them in automatically (`skill`
and `sk` are aliases). If a tool isn't linked yet, run `sloop sync`.

Imported skills are recorded in **`.sloop/skills.lock`** (name + source + content hash). Commit it so
your team gets reproducible skills, and run `sloop skills update` (`up`) to re-fetch from the recorded
sources — only changed files are rewritten and relinked. Locally authored (`skills new`) skills aren't
locked, since they have no upstream source.

---

## 6. Inventory

```sh
sloop tools     # adapters + install status
sloop ls        # registered workspaces + recent sessions (history, from SQLite)
sloop doctor    # environment health (tools, tmux, mode)
```

(`ls` = registry/history; `ps` = what's live right now.)

---

## 7. Shell completion (autocomplete)

Install once, then Tab-complete commands, flags **and live values**:

```sh
# zsh (add to ~/.zshrc, or drop into a completions dir)
source <(sloop completion zsh)
# bash
source <(sloop completion bash)
# fish
sloop completion fish | source
```

Completion is **dynamic**: `sloop run <Tab>` lists your tools, `-w <Tab>` lists registered
workspaces, and `sloop ps`/`send`/`attach <Tab>` list the sessions running right now (with the
session name shown next to each `ps` number).

---

## 8. Hints (learn as you go)

New to tmux/CLI? sloop occasionally prints one short `💡` tip after a command — what "detach" means,
how `ps` works, that `hooks install` makes status precise. They're **contextual** (tied to the
command), **throttled** (never more than one every few minutes, no repeats), and **offline** (ship
with the binary, updated on new releases).

```sh
sloop hints            # list every tip in your language
sloop hints off        # turn tips off   (sloop hints on to re-enable)
SLOOP_LANG=vi sloop …  # tips in Vietnamese (en + vi ship today)
SLOOP_NO_HINTS=1 …     # one-off: silence tips for a single command
```

Language is picked from `SLOOP_LANG` → the `lang` field in `~/.sloop/config.yaml` → `$LANG` → English.
Add a language by adding its key to `internal/hints/hints.yaml`. (A future release may also pull an
updated hint set from a registry / the global DB — embedded is the source for now.)

---

## Full dogfood walkthrough

```sh
# Two real projects
cd ~/code/api && sloop init && $EDITOR AGENTS.md      # fill in guidance
cd ~/code/web && sloop init && $EDITOR AGENTS.md

# Work the api with a coder + reviewer side by side
cd ~/code/api && sloop run --split claude cursor

# Detach (Ctrl-b d), start the web one too
cd ~/code/web && sloop run claude

# From anywhere, see the whole fleet and who needs you
sloop ps
sloop ps 1        # jump to the one that's waiting
```

**What to watch for while dogfooding:** does `sloop ps` + the glance line actually let you triage
"which agent needs me" across repos faster than flipping through tmux windows yourself? That's the
question that decides whether the orchestration direction is worth doubling down on.

---

## Limits (today)

- Orchestration (`ps`, `run --split`, `attach`, `send`) needs a tmux-compatible multiplexer:
  **tmux** on macOS/Linux, **psmux** on native Windows (auto-detected; `SLOOP_MUX` overrides).
  Without one, the orchestration commands are unavailable but everything else (`init`, `sync`,
  `skills`, `hooks`, `tools`, `status`, the registry DB) works fine. The multiplexer backend lives in
  `internal/tmux` behind the `runner.Runner` seam. **Note:** the psmux path is wired but not yet
  verified on a real Windows box — please report flag incompatibilities.
- The `ps` glance is a heuristic by default; install each tool's hooks (`sloop hooks install`) to make
  status authoritative.
- `sloop` launches tool binaries directly (no shell), so an adapter's `launch:` must be a plain
  command, not a shell pipeline.
